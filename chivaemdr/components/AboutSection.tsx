            Chi’Va is a platform designed to address $47 billion in annual inefficiencies within the U.S. behavioral health market—a figure projected to grow to $136 billion by 2032. Currently in its pilot stage, Chi’Va leverages OpenAI’s LLM capabilities. We are raising $500,000 to achieve SOC2 and ISO 27001 compliance, implement advanced security monitoring for enterprise-level integrations, and support critical development, including proprietary paywall solutions, AI/ML token optimization, and scalable infrastructure. These advancements will enable Chi’Va to recover lost revenue for healthcare systems and providers while improving care accessibility. Our early traction underscores the platform’s potential, and we are eager to build on this momentum with the support of an experienced mentor who can help us refine and scale our vision.
