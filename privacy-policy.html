				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

				<p>
					Chi'va Pocket Therapist ("we," "us," or "our") is committed
					to protecting your privacy and safeguarding your personal
					information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect,
					use, and share personal data when you interact with our
					website, mobile application, and services (collectively, the
					"Services").
				</p>

				<p>
					We comply with all applicable privacy laws, including the
					<strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>,
					<strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</strong>, and
					other relevant legal frameworks to ensure that your personal
					information is protected.
				</p>

					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Therapeutic Data:</strong> Chi'va Pocket
						Therapist uses proprietary algorithms to deliver
						EMDR-based services. While we do not collect or store
						detailed session data beyond anonymized information, we
						may collect usage metrics for product improvement and
						user experience enhancement.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Payment Information:</strong> When you make a
						purchase or payment for our Services, we collect payment
						card details and related financial information, but this
						information is processed through a third-party payment
						processor. We do not store or access full payment card
						details.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
				<p>
					We use the personal data we collect for the following
					purposes:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Provision of Services:</strong> To provide and
						personalize our Services, including delivering
						therapeutic guidance based on EMDR principles.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Improvement of Services:</strong> We use
						anonymized and aggregated data to improve the
						functionality and performance of our platform.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Communication:</strong> To send important
						notifications about changes to our Services, updates,
						marketing communications (if you have opted in), or
						respond to your inquiries.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Security and Compliance:</strong> We may use
						your information to prevent fraud, ensure compliance
						with our Terms of Service, and comply with legal
						requirements.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
				<p>
					Chi'va Pocket Therapist does not sell or rent your personal
					information to third parties. We may share your personal
					data in the following situations:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Service Providers:</strong> We work with trusted
						third-party service providers (e.g., cloud storage,
						payment processors) who perform functions on our behalf.
						These providers are contractually bound to protect your
						data and only use it for the purposes of providing
						services to us.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose
						your information if required to do so by law, in
						response to a valid subpoena, or to protect our rights
						or the rights of others.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a
						merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your personal
						data may be transferred as part of the business
						transaction, but you will be notified of any such
						changes.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>4. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
				<p>
					Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights
					over your personal data, including:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Right to Access:</strong> You may request access
						to your personal data that we collect and process.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Right to Correction:</strong> You have the right
						to correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal
						information.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Right to Deletion:</strong> You may request that
						we delete your personal information, subject to certain
						legal requirements or exceptions.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> You may
						request a copy of your personal data in a portable
						format.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> Where we
						rely on your consent to process your personal
						information, you have the right to withdraw that consent
						at any time.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					For California residents, the
					<strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</strong>
					gives you additional rights, such as the right to know what
					personal information is collected, disclosed, or sold, and
					the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information
					(although we do not sell personal information).
				</p>
				<p>
					To exercise these rights, please contact us at
					<strong>[Insert Contact Email]</strong>.
				</p>

				<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
				<p>
					We retain your personal data for as long as necessary to
					fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and to
					comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce
					agreements. When personal data is no longer required, we
					securely delete or anonymize it.
				</p>

				<h2>6. Security</h2>
				<p>
					We implement industry-standard security measures to protect
					your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or
					disclosure. However, no security system is impenetrable, and
					we cannot guarantee the complete security of your data.
				</p>

				<h2>7. International Transfers</h2>
				<p>
					If you access our Services from outside the United States,
					your personal data may be transferred to and processed in
					the U.S. or other countries where we or our service
					providers operate. We ensure that any data transfers comply
					with applicable privacy laws, and we use appropriate
					safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses, to protect
					your data.
				</p>

				<h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
				<p>
					Chi'va Pocket Therapist is not intended for use by
					individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect
					personal information from children under 18. If you believe
					we have collected data from a child without appropriate
					consent, please contact us at
					<strong>[Insert Contact Email]</strong>, and we will take
					appropriate steps to delete the information.
				</p>

				<h2>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>
					We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect
					changes in our practices, technology, legal requirements, or
					other factors. When we make changes, we will update the
					"Effective Date" at the top of the policy. We encourage you
					to review this page periodically for the latest information
					on our privacy practices.
