						<h3>Addressing Customer Pain Points</h3>

						<p>
							<span class="baloo-paaji-2-logo">Chi'Va™</span> is a
							a trademarked AI-powered platform designed to
							improve efficiency and outcomes in behavioral health
							care. It addresses critical challenges such as
							revenue retention and operational strain by
							integrating streamlined processes with
							evidence-based methodologies. Leveraging advanced
							AI/ML technology, Chi'Va enables healthcare network
							managers and providers to focus on delivering
							high-quality outcomes while achieving improved ROI.
						</p>
						<p>
							Chi’Va is a platform designed to address $47 billion
							in annual inefficiencies within the U.S. behavioral
							health market—a figure projected to grow to $136
							billion by 2032. Currently in its pilot stage,
							Chi’Va leverages OpenAI’s LLM capabilities. We are
							raising $500,000 to achieve SOC2 and ISO 27001
							compliance, implement advanced security monitoring
							for enterprise-level integrations, and support
							critical development, including proprietary paywall
							solutions, AI/ML token optimization, and scalable
							infrastructure. These advancements will enable
							Chi’Va to recover lost revenue for healthcare
							systems and providers while improving care
							accessibility. Our early traction underscores the
							platform’s potential, and we are eager to build on
							this momentum with the support of an experienced
							mentor who can help us refine and scale our vision.
